# Anyone can Design! With a little help from Generative AI

With a recent surge in generative AI systems, new collaboration possibilities have emerged between humans and AI for creative content. The role of AI has changed from decision-maker to human supporter. However, there are very few studies that have explored these collaborations. Further, generating creative content with AI requires a good understanding of the algorithms and their features. In this work, we studied human-computer co-creativity for poster design tasks. We recruited two participant groups and assigned them the task of designing two different types of posters. One of the groups was provided with a taxonomy designed by us to guide the design process. Later, we compared the completion time, design process, and prompt used between the taxonomy and non-taxonomy group. Further, we conducted a qualitative survey to gauge the participant's experience.
